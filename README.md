## Exercise: Simple Language Translator

####  Objective:

Practice using HashMap to create a basic language translator.

#### Description:

Create a program that simulates a simple language translator using a HashMap. The program should allow users to add word translations, look up translations, display the translator's contents, and exit the program.

#### Guidelines:

- Create a HashMap to store words in one language as keys and their corresponding translations in another language as values.
- Implement a loop that displays a menu with the following options:
    - Add translation
    - Look up translation
    - Display translator
    - Exit

Depending on the selected option, perform the following tasks:

1.	To add a translation, take input from the user for the word in one language and its translation in another language, and add it to the HashMap.
2.	To look up a translation, take input from the user for the word in one language and retrieve the corresponding translation from the HashMap.
3.	To display the translator, iterate through the HashMap and print each word and its translation.
4.	To exit, terminate the program.
